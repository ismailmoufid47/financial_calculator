# Financial Calculator

## Overview

The Financial Calculator is a Python application that provides three financial calculations: Future Value, Present Value, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). It offers both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user convenience.

## Calculations

### 1. Future Value

The Future Value calculation estimates the value of an investment after a specified period, taking into account the initial principal, annual interest rate, and the time in years.

### 2. Present Value

The Present Value calculation determines the current value of a future payment or series of payments, considering the future value, discount rate, and time in years.

### 3. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

The CAGR calculation provides the annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period, based on the initial and final values.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI allows users to interact with the Financial Calculator in an intuitive manner. It provides an easy-to-use interface for entering input values and viewing results. The GUI supports all three financial calculations.

To launch the GUI, run the script and type 'yes' when prompted for the interface.

## Additional Features

- **Visualization**: When using the CLI, users have the option to visualize the results through matplotlib plots.

- **Error Handling**: The application performs extensive error checking to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted.

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose between the CLI and GUI interfaces based on their preferences.
